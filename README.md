# Data Science Portfolio - Seungbae Son
This portfolio is the compilation of all data science projects I created to find solutions by exploring data. This portfolio contains 4 categories with a wide range of topics, such as Classification, Regression, Neural Networks, Image Recognition, and AI algorithms.

## Classification Problems

### Credit Default Prediction
Credit Default Prediction is a Kaggle competition from American Express. The objective of this competition was to build a model to predict credit default by using customers' data. The dataset contains 5.5M+ data with 189 features and a lot of missing data. Since there was no information about explanatory variables, I applied a variety of feature engineering techniques to create significant features. I finished this competition in the top 5% among 4,874 teams on the public leaderboard. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/KevinSBSon/Credit-Default-Prediction).<br>

## Regression Problems

### Coming Year's Most Popular Music Prediction
The objective of this project was to build a model to predict the new trend in music in the coming year. I used a music dataset from Spotify that consists of 169k songs with their characteristics, such as danceability, energy, duration, etc. The predictive model is built by combining multiple time series regression models on each feature. The cosine similarity is applied to identify the close relationship between predicted data and the new most popular songs. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/KevinSBSon/Coming-Years-Most-Popular-Music-Prediction).
